## Cool, how do I use this?

In order to use this app, you'll have to run it locally, because craiglist blocks most commercial deployment servers. First, clone this repo into a directory on your machine.

### Wait, will I get in trouble?

I've been updating this project over the course of a year, and have tested it at least 100s of times, and have yet to be blocked or receive nasty messages from craigslist.

##Getting Started
First, you'll want to start a virtual environment and activate it. Then
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

##Run the App
In the root directory, run
`python run.py`
and open the url in a browser.

##How To Use
0. Lay out yoga mat. Brew green tea.
1. Conduct a search on the real craiglist, and copy your URL. 
2. Paste the url into the input box on Craigslist Zen Mode. 
3. Press submit and wait about 90 seconds. 
4. Feast your eyes on *all* of the pictures from the listings, with color tints signalling when a new listing begins. Click on the picture to be taken to the listing.
