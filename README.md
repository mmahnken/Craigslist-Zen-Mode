Craigslist-Zen-Mode
===================

A solution for people who think that there is too much clicking and reading on craigslist.

This is a flask app. I'm not able to deploy it because craiglist blocks IPs on Heroku and AWS. 
In order to use this app, you'll have to run it locally. Clone this repo into a directory on your machine.

##Getting Started
First, you'll want to start a virtual environment and activate it. Then
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

##Run the App
In the root directory, run
`python run.py`
and open the url in a browser.

##How To Use
1. Conduct a search on the real craiglist, and copy your URL. 
2. Paste the url into the input box on Craigslist Zen Mode. 
3. Press submit and wait about 90 seconds. 
4. Feast your eyes on *all* of the pictures from the listings, with color tints signalling when a new listing begins.
